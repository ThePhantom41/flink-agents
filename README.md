## Introduction

Flink Agents combines the strengths of Apache Flink with the concept of Agentic AI. This framework allows developers to create intelligent agents that can communicate, learn, and adapt in real-time. Whether you are building a recommendation system, a smart assistant, or any other AI-driven application, Flink Agents provides the tools you need.

## Features

- **Distributed Architecture**: Run your agents across multiple nodes for scalability.
- **Event-Driven**: Respond to events in real-time for immediate action.
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Create and manage multiple agents seamlessly.
- **Integration with Java and Python**: Use the language you prefer for development.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Handle data as it arrives for timely insights.

public class FlinkAgentExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        final StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
        
        env.fromElements("Hello", "Flink", "Agents")
           .map(new MapFunction<String, String>() {
               @Override
               public String map(String value) {
                   return value + " World!";
               }
           })
           .print();

        env.execute("Flink Agent Example");
    }
}
```

### Python Example

```python
from flink import StreamExecutionEnvironment

def main():
    env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment()
    
    env.from_collection(["Hello", "Flink", "Agents"]) \
       .map(lambda value: f"{value} World!") \
       .print()

    env.execute("Flink Agent Example")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
